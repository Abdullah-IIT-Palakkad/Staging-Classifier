# Staging-Classifier
## Aug 2021 - Present | Dr. Mrinal Kanti Das
- Developed a staging classifier based on attention CNNs; evaluating its performance against existing approaches such as SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) an image processing method, and a classical U-Net based approach
- Developing a multimodal framework (using NSCLC Radiogenomics dataset with demographic, histologic, and genomic data) based on GNNs to enhance accuracy of the staging classifier
